#### Connect 4 Game

I developed a Connect 4 game in Python, incorporating the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient AI decision-making. The game features three difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert, each defined by the depth of moves the AI evaluates. The AI uses a heuristic scoring system, analyzing board segments and accounting for strategic positions, such as the central column. The game assesses various win conditions and dynamically scores board states to choose optimal moves. Visual demonstrations include the AI evaluating board positions and making strategic decisions, showcasing its ability to prune unnecessary evaluations and focus on the most promising moves.

Further explanation and visual demonstrations can be found at my GitHub repository along with the code: [Github Repository](https://github.com/Jakeh766/Connect4)

#### Handwritten Data Processing Application

I created this application for my Dad's farming business. The application processes scanned images of breeding and farrowing records to generate comprehensive reports. Users start by inputting relevant dates and group numbers and then uploading the breeding and farrowing record files. The program converts these files to PNG format and uses the AWS Textract API to extract tabular data, which is then converted into Pandas DataFrames for cleaning. Errors are highlighted in red for manual correction. After corrections, the program merges the Dataframes and generates a PDF report. Users can review the report and export the group's data to an Excel database. This efficient workflow ensures accurate and organized record-keeping for breeding and farrowing operations.

### Volunteering and Leadership

#### Mavs in Action 
**Secretary | Minnesota State University | Mankato, MN** _(Aug 2023 - May 2024)_
       
I served as the secretary for Mavs in Action, a student volunteer club at MNSU from August 2023 to May 2024. During that time, I logged over **150** volunteer service hours, helped plan and lead weekly volunteering activities, and started a new campus-wide children's book drive initiative. I started planning the book drive in the fall of 2023. I first reached out to local community organizations to see who would accept children's books as donations. Then once I had organizations who were interested and expressed a need for books, I reached out to student groups on campus as well as faculty to start promoting the book drive. Along with the Mavs in Action leadership board, I helped organize a coordinated social media campaign to raise awareness of the book drive. I also helped manage the budget and logistics of storing and delivering the books. We ended up collecting over **300** books. As a result of my leadership efforts, I was selected to be on the Spring 2024 BEST Board.
