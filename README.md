I developed a Connect 4 game in Python, incorporating the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient AI decision-making. The game features three difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert, each defined by the depth of moves the AI evaluates. The AI uses a heuristic scoring system, analyzing board segments and accounting for strategic positions, such as the central column. The game assesses various win conditions and dynamically scores board states to choose optimal moves. Visual demonstrations include the AI evaluating board positions and making strategic decisions, showcasing its ability to prune unnecessary evaluations and focus on the most promising moves.

#### MUDAC

#### Capstone Project

#### Data Derby

#### Handwritten Data Processing Application

I created this application for my Dad's farming business. The application processes scanned images of breeding and farrowing records to generate comprehensive reports. Users start by inputting relevant dates and group numbers and then uploading the breeding and farrowing record files. The program converts these files to PNG format and uses the AWS Textract API to extract tabular data, which is then converted into Pandas DataFrames for cleaning. Errors are highlighted in red for manual correction. After corrections, the program merges the Dataframes and generates a PDF report. Users can review the report and export the group's data to an Excel database. This efficient workflow ensures accurate and organized record-keeping for breeding and farrowing operations.
