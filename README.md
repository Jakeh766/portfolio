I developed a Connect 4 game in Python, incorporating the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient AI decision-making. The game features three difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert, each defined by the depth of moves the AI evaluates. The AI uses a heuristic scoring system, analyzing board segments and accounting for strategic positions, such as the central column. The game assesses various win conditions and dynamically scores board states to choose optimal moves. Visual demonstrations include the AI evaluating board positions and making strategic decisions, showcasing its ability to prune unnecessary evaluations and focus on the most promising moves.

Further explanation and visual demonstrations can be found at my GitHub repository along with the code: [Github Repository](https://github.com/Jakeh766/Connect4)
